This project's goal is to through genetic programming evolve an artificial intelligence that can play the abstract strategy board game [Traverse](http://www.educationallearninggames.com/how-to-play-traverse-game.asp) (a.k.a. _Taifho_).

This project is developed for the 2010 course [TIN171 Artificial Intelligence](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/edu/course/TIN171/) at [Chalmers University of Technology](http://chalmers.se/).

The project uses JGAP, which can be installed from http://sourceforge.net/projects/jgap/files/.


**Update:** The genetic programming approach was a failure, and a minimax search approach was successful, and is the one currently used.

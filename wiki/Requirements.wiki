#summary Requirements and visions for the project

= Introduction =

The intent is to explore how a genetic programming approach can be used to develop an artificial intelligence that plays a abstract strategy board game.

The ultimate vision for the end product is a complete, graphical Traverse game where a human player can play against our AI.


= Details =

== Programming language ==

The programming language we will use for the GUI will be Java.
For the genetic algorithm, ... will be used and the expressions that are evolved will be Lisp (Maybe???)


== Game rules ==

=== Simplified rules for first version ===

* No long jumps
* Only two players
* 4x4 board
* Only square pieces

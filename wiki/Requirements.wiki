#summary Requirements and visions for the project

= Introduction =

The intent is to explore how a genetic programming approach can be used to develop an artificial intelligence that plays a abstract strategy board game.

The ultimate vision for the end product is a complete, graphical Traverse game where a human player can play against our AI.


= Details =

== Programming language ==

The programming language we will use for the GUI will be Java.
For the genetic algorithm, a Java open source framework will probably be used.


== Game rules ==

=== First version ===

 # No long jumps
 # Only two players
 # 4x4 board
 # Only square pieces

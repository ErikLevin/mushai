\Section{Summary}

The goal of this project is to explore how genetic programming can be used to develop an artificial intelligence that plays the board game Traverse.

If the task is deemed infeasible to carry out with genetic programming we will instead use a more conventional search method such as minmax tree. Initially we will study both approaches in parallel.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\Section{Key ideas}

\SubSection{What do you propose to do?}

We aim to develop an artificial intelligence that plays Traverse reasonably well. It should at least play significantly better than random playing (i.e. win practically every time), and ideally be as good as an amateur human player.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{What interesting and related things are outside the scope of your project?}

One thought from our supervisor was to try and develop a program that could incrementally learn the rules of the game (and by extension, any board game) by attempting moves and letting the user confirm whether the move was legal or not. This is a very interesting area, but outside the scope of this project. We will predefine the rules of the game and not let it be up to the user.

Comparing with full-blown search methods. Won't be time to develop as well. ???

Measuring how good the AI is, if it is above amateur level. We can make estimations.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
\SubSection{Why do you believe your approach will work?}

Because our brains were made through evolution, and they can play Traverse on the level of an amateur.

GP can quickly locate good solutions even for complex search spaces... Which Traverse has.

%------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
\SubSection{What will you accomplish?}

If you succeed, what will you accomplish? Why is it interesting and significant?

We will have BECOME AS GODS! MWAHAHAHAHAHA!

\section{Survey}
You should find published work or results that help you define the project, explain its significance, and demonstrate the value of various approaches to your task. If you cannot find work directly applicable to your project, try to find work on related problems, and adapt the results to your project.

\subsection{Literature}
One paper examining the nature of solvable games is \cite{games_solved}, in which several properties of games appear such as the game-theoretic value (first-player win, second-player win or draw) and whether games are divergent or convergent. The article proposes a matrix of four different categories of games, signifying how hard they are to fully solve: ... As a pre-study in our report, we will reason about how these properties apply to Traverse to anticipate whether the game is feasible to solve with current computational power. Our hypothesis is that it is not solvable, which provides an incentive for trying other methods for a playing algorithm, such as genetic programming.

\subsection{Tools and programs}

\subsection{Benchmarks}

In \cite{games_solved}, a way of measuring how good game playing artificial intelligences are is proposed. The agent is placed in categories for playing at amateur level, grand master level, world champion level, better than any human, and being completely solved. Since we do not have access to any human or artificial players of higher level than amateur, we will not be able to assess our program's category in this taxonomy fully. We do, however, intend to determine whether it is better, worse or about equal to a human amateur.

Compare with:
random player (should be significantly better)
no opponent, just homerun on empty board
one-strategy player
human
mathematically computed optimal solution (for small boards)

\section{Evaluation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item{How will you measure progress and results?}
	\item{What experiments will you perform to prove your hypothesis?}
	\item{Are there any standard data sets/benchmarks to evaluate the performance of your application?}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item{If YES, you should directly use those as a metric to evaluate the performance}
		\item{If NO, you should define a set of general metric to make the evaluation unbiased}
	\end{itemize}
	\item{For example you can collect some standard inputs from the real world scenario for your application, for which you know the actual results. Then you can compare the performance of your application against the actual results}
\end{itemize}

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Initial results}
You should have a few small (or toy) programs as proof of concept, and to give reason to believe your approach will succeed.

%-----------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Project management}
\begin{itemize}
	\item{What are the major tasks to accomplish?}
	\item{Who will do what?}
	\item{Try to define a tentative schedule showing when you will start and finish each task!}
\end{itemize}
However, please note that it is unwise to leave any task entirely to just one person. The others should at least follow it fairly closely, so that someone can take over the task in case of illness or absence.

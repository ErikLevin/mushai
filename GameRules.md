<img src='http://mushai.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/gameboard.jpg' />
<p>Traverse (also called Taifho) is a fun strategy board game mixing features from chess and checkers. Up to four players compete to be the first to move all their game pieces to the opposite side of the game board.</p>

## Players ##
2-4, all ages.

## Contents ##
One game board made up of a 10 x 10 square grid with a checker pattern on the inner 8 x 8 squares. The edges are starting rows and destination rows for the different players.

32 game pieces in total with four different colours; 8 pieces per player in the same colour: 2 squares, 2 diamonds, 2 triangles and 2 circles.

## Goal ##
The winner of Traverse is the first player to move all of his of her pieces from his or her starting row to the destination row on the opposite side of the game board.

If one player can indefinitely prevent the opponent's last piece from moving into the destination row by a repetitive blocking action, the game is declared over. The player who was blocked out is declared the winner.

## Setup ##
Players arrange their pieces in any order along one side of the board, not including the corners of the board, making sure that diamonds and triangles point forward.

## Playing the game ##
Players take turns, moving only one piece each turn. The different pieces move differently according to their shape:<br />
|<img src='http://mushai.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/square.jpg' />|Squares can move only horizontally and vertically.|
|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------|
|<img src='http://mushai.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/diamond.jpg' />|Diamonds can only move diagonally.|
|<img src='http://mushai.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/triangle.jpg' />|Triangles can move forward on the diagonals or straight backwards.|
|<img src='http://mushai.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/images/circel.jpg' />|Circles can move in all eight directions.|

Players are only allowed to move one piece (according to its shape's movement rules) one space each turn to an empty adjacent space or by jumping over an adjacent piece (belonging to any player). Players are also allowed to make a sequence of jumps in one turn if each individual jump follows the movement rules of the piece. The next jump in a sequence of jumps must begin where the previous jump ended. Pieces that are jumped over are not captured or affected in any way.

## Additional rules ##
  * Two pieces cannot occupy the same space.
  * Players are only allowed to (and must) skip a turn if they cannot move any of his or her pieces.
  * Players are not allowed to end their move within their starting row, unless the piece started out in their starting row.
  * Players are otherwise not allowed to end their move along any of the four sides or in the corners, but it is allowed to temporarily move a piece to any such space in a sequence of jumps that do not end on any of theses spaces.
  * Players are allowed to move and jump with pieces into, within and out of the destination row.
  * The board must not look the same after a single move as before it
